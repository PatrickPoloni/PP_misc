# PP_misc

This is a collective of texts I've either written myself or with GPT-4. I will label it accordingly in the description. Just some Misc stuff in general.
Scratch the above line, I wont label it, too much work. All my work is done by me and GPT-4, until there's a better LLM.

Heuristic Ethical Learning Paradigm or HELP is a little text that wants to interconnect David Shapiro's Heuristic Imperatives (which are already golden) with ethics and learning. It's mostly a joke for myself because of "help". Have a good read, but do not take it serious. I lied, take it serious, I stand by it. It's an important fragment for aligned systems such as humans and AI, AGIs.

morale coding (title will change) is a text that outlines how emotion influences morale and ethical imperatives. It reconfigure the seven base emotions by paul ekman into generations, establishes pain and joy as a dualistic pairing and goes on to explain values and morale/ethics. -> the morale coding text will be replaced by "emotional coding". I will let this version stay for transperancy sake and upload the new version soon 

universal philosophy is a dialogue with GPT-4 about the nature of the universe and reality. It reflects my philosophy well on these outlooks, they propagate throughout all aspects of life and the values written in it are my own. That a transformer is capable of guessing correctly the next words that align to my own philosophy is a sign for me that the alignment issue is not as grave as AI researchers want it to be. It just depends on the training data, on the life lived. That being said, it makes training data extremely valueable.

next projects: alignment text, consciousness creation theory & Bodymind,"the future of goverment": e-democracy text,
