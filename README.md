# PP_misc

This is a collective of texts I've either written myself or with GPT-4. I will label it accordingly in the description. Just some Misc stuff in general.
Scratch the above line, I wont label it, too much work. All my work is done by me and GPT-4, until there's a better LLM.

Heuristic Ethical Learning Paradigm or HELP is a little text that wants to interconnect David Shapiro's Heuristic Imperatives (which are already golden) with ethics and learning. It's mostly a joke for myself because of "help". Have a good read, but do not take it serious.

morale coding (title will change) is a text that outlines how emotion influences morale and ethical imperatives. It reconfigure the seven base emotions by paul ekman into generations, establishes pain and joy as a dualistic pairing and goes on to explain values and morale/etics (latter part not yet written). I will update this work more often, because I am actively thinking about it.
