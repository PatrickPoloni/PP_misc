This is a collective of texts I've either written myself or with GPT-4. I will label it accordingly in the description. Just some Misc stuff in general.
Scratch the above line, I wont label it, too much work. All my work is done by me and GPT-4.

Heuristic Ethical Learning Paradigm or HELP is a little text that wants to interconnect David Shapiro's Heuristic Imperatives (which are already golden) with ethics and learning. It's mostly a joke for myself because of "help". Have a good read, but do not take it serious. I lied, take it serious, I stand by it. It's an important fragment for aligned systems such as humans and AI, AGIs.

morale coding (title will change) is a text that outlines how emotion influences morale and ethical imperatives. It reconfigure the seven base emotions by paul ekman into generations, establishes pain and joy as a dualistic pairing and goes on to explain values and morale/ethics. -> the morale coding text will be replaced by "emotional coding". I will let this version stay for transperancy sake and upload the new version soon 

universal philosophy is a dialogue with GPT-4 about the nature of the universe and reality. It reflects my philosophy well on these outlooks, they propagate throughout all aspects of life and the values written in it are my own. That a transformer is capable of guessing correctly the next words that align to my own philosophy is a sign for me that the alignment issue is not as grave as AI researchers want it to be. It just depends on the training data, on the life lived. That being said, it makes training data extremely valueable.

utopia and plea between the stars PDF are just quick and dirty answers to questions never asked.. I had a feeling that I needed to bring them, so I did. They pretty much absorbed my innermost feeling about those two desires. Written by GPT-4.

3-CUT("3-Consciousness Universal Theory") is a theory of mind. In short, the mind is a 7D space, each object in it loops in itself and into each other. the 7D refers to 3D of space, 1D of time and 3D of CEV (cognition, emotion and value). Consciousness arises by integrating information on all 7D. Each pattern of mind is absolute unique. It integrates the Integrated Information Theory as a mechanism. Why not use the IIT instead? This theory was born out of CEV, by the simple assumption that sensation is all what you need to trigger higher level values, this gave rise to 3-CUT. In general, I try to integrate all theories, since they are born from different minds. In my pov all theories are valueable and need to align with my basic theory. With 3-CUT I have the least assumptions and no orthogonality with any other theory.
